## Architecture

The project is structured as a Cargo workspace with five crates, organised so that the core emulation has zero OS or I/O dependencies:

```
AppleWin-rs/
├── crates/
│   ├── apple2-core       # Pure emulation engine (CPU, bus, cards)
│   ├── apple2-audio      # Audio synthesis (speaker, AY8910, SSI263)
│   ├── apple2-video      # Video rendering (NTSC, RGB, hi-res, double hi-res)
│   ├── apple2-debugger   # Symbolic debugger (disassembler, breakpoints, symbols)
│   └── applewin          # Main application, GUI, and platform I/O
├── roms/                 # All ROM files (embedded at compile time via include_bytes!)
│   └── firmware/         # ProDOS, DOS 3.3, and utility firmware binaries
└── bin/                  # Runtime resources (disk images, symbol tables)
```

### Crate Responsibilities

| Crate | Purpose | Key Dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| `apple2-core` | 6502/65C02 CPU, memory bus, 21 expansion card implementations | `bitflags`, `thiserror`, `tracing`, `serde` |
| `apple2-audio` | AY8910 PSG synthesis, SSI263 speech, speaker emulation | `thiserror`, `tracing`, `serde` |
| `apple2-video` | Framebuffer (560x384), NTSC signal chain, all video mode rendering | `apple2-core`, `thiserror`, `tracing`, `serde` |
| `apple2-debugger` | Disassembler, breakpoint manager, symbol table loader | `apple2-core`, `thiserror`, `tracing`, `serde` |
| `applewin` | GUI (egui/eframe), audio output (cpal), gamepad (gilrs), config (toml) | all above + `eframe`, `cpal`, `gilrs`, `rfd`, `png` |

### Design Principles

- **`apple2-core` is OS-agnostic** — no platform code, no I/O; purely emulation logic.
- **Subsystem crates** (`audio`, `video`, `debugger`) depend only on `apple2-core`.
- **`applewin`** is the only crate with platform and GUI dependencies.
- **ROMs are centralised** in the top-level `roms/` directory and embedded at compile time via `include_bytes!` — no runtime file loading required.
- **Headless mode** is available (no GUI/audio dependencies) for testing and CI.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain: **1.85+** (edition 2024 workspace) — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- **Windows:** MSVC build tools (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target)
- **Linux:** system packages for audio, GUI, and gamepad:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libgtk-3-dev \
      libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev \
      libxkbcommon-dev libudev-dev
  ```
- **macOS:** standard Xcode command-line tools

### Standard (GUI) Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AaronSaikovski/AppleWin-rs.git
cd AppleWin-rs
cargo build --release
```

The release binary is produced at:

```
target/release/applewin        # Linux/macOS
target/release/applewin.exe    # Windows
```

### Headless Build (no GUI, no audio)

Useful for CI, automated testing, or embedding:

```sh
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features headless
```

### Run

```sh
cargo run --release
```

Or run the compiled binary directly:

```sh
./target/release/applewin
```

### Cargo Features

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gui` | yes | Enables the full egui/eframe GUI, audio (cpal), gamepad (gilrs), and file dialogs (rfd) |
| `headless` | no | Strips all GUI/audio/I/O for pure emulation builds |

### Testing

```sh
cargo test
```

Runs 286 tests across all crates:

| Crate | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `apple2-core` | 251 | CPU opcodes (6502/65C02/undocumented), addressing modes, BCD arithmetic, interrupts, soft switches, language card, ALTZP memory routing, expansion cards, Disk II controller |
| `apple2-core` (integration) | 9 | Boot sequence, program execution, snapshots, Fibonacci |
| `apple2-audio` | 10 | Speaker interpolation, DC filter, amplitude, WAV recording |
| `apple2-video` | 14 | NTSC tables, text/lores/hires/dlores rendering, mixed mode |
| `apple2-debugger` | 2 | Disassembly |

## Configuration

On first run, `applewin` creates a TOML config file in the platform-standard location:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\applewin-rs\config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/applewin-rs/config.toml` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/applewin-rs/config.toml` |

### Configurable Options

- **Machine:** Model, CPU type (6502/65C02), slot card assignments
- **Video:** Mode, scanlines, color blending, monochrome color, refresh rate
- **Audio:** Master volume (0-100%)
- **Speed:** Emulation speed (0-40, 10 = normal), enhanced disk speed (16x during motor spin)
- **Input:** Joystick type per port, paddle trim, auto-fire, self-centering, button swap, mouse options
- **Memory:** RAM initialization pattern (0-7), custom ROM paths
- **Save state:** Auto-save on exit, custom save state path
- **UI:** Window scale, position, disk activity LEDs, confirm reboot dialog

### Save States

Save states are stored in YAML format alongside the config file as `applewin-rs.aws.yaml`. Use F11 to save and Shift+F11 to restore. Optionally enable auto-save on exit in the settings.

### Screenshots

Screenshots are saved as PNG files to `%APPDATA%\applewin-rs\screenshots\` on Windows, or the current directory on other platforms.
